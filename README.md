# School District Analysis

## Overview 

The following is an analysis of a school district's standardized test scores to provide insights into performance trends and patterns in relation to school spending, school size, and school type. After scores belonging to the Thomas High School ninth grade were found to show evidence of academic dishonesty, the analysis was undertaken a second time with those scores affected being voided. The differences between the original analysis and the second excluding ninth grade scores from Thomas High School are discussed below.
